# FedEx Shipping Label Preview & Print
Just a simple tool I created to help visualize and print base64 encoded FedEx shipping labels returned in their ShipService web service response.

## How it works
1. Decodes the base64 encoded shipping label response (which is in base64)
1. Then it decodes the base64 image

## How to use
- Just select Fedex Label (Base64 to Image) at the top and paste in the textbox and click "Convert to Image".
- Click on the image box to open up an image preview.

## Extras
- Create a custom peripheral / packing label
